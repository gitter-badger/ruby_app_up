# `ruby_app_up`

[ ![Codeship Status for jdickey/ruby_app_up](https://codeship.com/projects/ce8a39d0-536d-0132-1cc6-5e1d8dbac3c9/status)](https://codeship.com/projects/48939)

`ruby_app_up` is a tool for repeatably setting up an existing Github-based Ruby
(and incidentally Rails) repo for development on a local system. It is a command
line application presently based on [Thor](http://whatisthor.com).

It will:

* EVENTUALLY clone a Git repo (from a project identifier you **must** specify;
* EVENTUALLY allow you to select the branch to clone, using the `--branch` command-line option (defaults to `master`);
* EVENTUALLY cloning the repo to the subdirectory specified using the `--clone-to` command-line option (defaults to the default that Git uses, which is normally the bare repo name);
* EVENTUALLY changing to the new project directory;
* EVENTUALLY rebundling the app, bundling into `./vendor` unless the `--no-bundle-vendor` command-line option is specified;
* EVENTUALLY running `bundle package --all`, to cache the app's Gems for faster loading, unless the `--no-package` command line option is specified;
* EVENTUALLY running `rbenv rehash`, to update any Gem-supplied binaries in the `rbenv` load path;
* EVENTUALLY running `RAILS_ENV=test rake db:migrate db:reset db:seed` to initialise and seed the database, unless the `--no-setup-db` command-line option is specified; and finally
* EVENTUALLY running `rake` to run the default Rake task for the project, which normally runs RSpec, Rubocop and similar tools, unless the `--no-rake` command-line option is specified.

## Prerequisites

* Ruby, obviously. This was developed with 2.1.5, but *should* work with any post-2.0 release.
* RubyGems, for the `gem` command.

It installs the `thor` Gem if it's not already on your system. (If you can build a Rails application, you have `thor` installed.)

See the `ruby_app_up.gemspec` file for Gems used in development.

## Installation

Install this app via Rubygems:

```
$ gem install ruby_app_up
```

## Usage

Run `ruby_app_up` with the Github identifier of a project you wish to clone and set up on your local system. For example, to clone [The Next Big Thing](https://github.com/shageman/the_next_big_thing), you would run

```
ruby_app_up shageman/the_next_big_thing
```

This will go through the steps enumerated at the start of this README. Command-line options supported by this tool include:

| Option | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| `--branch BRANCHNAME` | Clone the `BRANCHNAME` branch on the repo, rather than the default `master`. |
| `--clone-to TARGET` | Clone the repo into the `TARGET` directory, rather than the Git default (a subdirectory of the current directory, with the name of the project). |
| `--no-bundle-vendor` | Don't bundle Gems into the project's `vendor` subdirectory, but into your system local Gem repository. |
| `--no-setup-db` | Skip running database migration, setup and seeding on the newly-bundled application. |
| `--no-package` | Don't cache the app's Gems for faster loading the next time the `bundle` command is run. |
| `--no-rake` | Don't run the project's `rake` script after cloning and setup is otherwise complete. |

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/jdickey/ruby_app_up/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request. To be accepted, PRs *must* include spec coverage of all new code, and *must* not trigger offences when running `rake rubocop`. *Pull requests not specifying a self-contained branch will be rejected.* (This means "don't make your changes on your copy of `master` or any other existing branch in the upstream repo".)
